# HappyMongo



## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of the web application designed to streamline the world of moving and parcel transportation. This initiative aims to connect people with the need for goods transportation to carriers with vehicles suitable for those needs, drawing inspiration from the successful UBER model.

This app has been developed as an assignment for the Factoria F5 Bootcamp, January-February 2024.
